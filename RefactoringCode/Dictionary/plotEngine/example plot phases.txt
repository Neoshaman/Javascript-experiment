 Phase 1
 At the beginning the "subject" is full and stable.
 Then a "guilty "agent"" came and create a victim,
 (a lack in the "subject" realm, [a close relation murdered, a crime] ),
 creating the desire of the "subject" to regain stability [seek revenge].
 
 Phase 2
 To regain this stability the "subject" want
 (by psychological rule) to create the same lack
 to the "guilty agent"" that have unbalanced its state.
 To do it, it seek a "subject"'s "agent" 
 that can fulfill this desire (preparation),
 some "agent" [institution] will prove to not be effective
 (has no skill) to fulfill its desire. 
 
 Phase3 (action driven)
 Once the "subject" find his "agent" [himself]
 it will chase the "guilty agent" (Or a related "Object"
 [to target the "guilty agent", the "subject"'s "Object" is a close one of the "guilty agent"] 
 that could create equivalent lack to the "guilty agent")
 as the "host" [Target a close one of the "guilty agent"] of his "Object" [seek revenge] 
 (create the same state it suffered to the "guilty agent"). 
 Between the "Object" And the "subject"'s "agent" [himself] there is steps To be cross
 and the "subject"'s "agent" [himself] use skill that are related To these steps.
 
 Phase 3' (character driven)
 During the "subject"'s "agent"'s [himself] journey to "Object" [seek revenge], 
 the "subject" will meet opponent [his moral, also close people]
 and allies [his desires, also close people] 
 that tries to weaken or strengthen his relation with the "Object" [seek revenge]. 
 If opponent [his moral, also close people] win, the "subject" would deconsider "Object" [seek revenge], 
 but allies [his desires, also close people] support consideration of the "Object" [seek revenge] 
 and pressure the suject to pursue his goal.
 
 
 Phase 4 sucess
 Once the "agent" [himself] have cross all steps to the "Object" [Target a close one of the "guilty agent"] 
 a final test is instantiate to cross the last treshold step 
 and fulfill the desire of the "subject". 
 At the end it will change the "subject" relation
 with his opponent [his moral, also close people] 
 and allie [his desires, also close people].
